# Survey Form Project
Welcome to the "Survey Form" project! This project is a simple survey form I created to learn the basic elements of HTML and CSS. As I worked on this project, I familiarized myself with various components such as buttons, survey forms, checkboxes, and more.

About the project
A survey form is designed to collect responses to user questions. It contains various elements that allow users to select options, answer questions and submit their answers. The project is designed using simple HTML and CSS techniques, making it a great place to start learning web development.
